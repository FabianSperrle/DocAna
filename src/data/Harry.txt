I
tried
hard
to
watch
this
but
I
kept
fall
asleep
The
movi
is
dark
in
it
film
but
not
in
it
character
So
the
film
put
you
into
a
mood
the
character
and
action
does
not
real
support
And
speak
of
action
this
mov
is
terrib
lack
The
previou
potter
movi
wer
action
pack
with
all
sort
of
jok
and
interaction
This
movi
has
som
action
then
it
goes
on
som
long
drawn
out
hiatu
The
character
blink
onto
som
desert
island
or
forest
and
it
tot
barren
And
they
sit
ther
and
look
at
each
other
for
lik
minut
I
just
can
t
get
into
it
Seem
lik
this
is
how
they
stretch
two
movi
out
of
this
By
put
in
all
this
dead
tim
Then
the
tension
between
the
main
character
seem
forc
and
strain
It
unnatur
bas
on
the
previou
film
Even
if
ther
is
som
under
magic
reason
for
it
it
does
not
com
acro
right
Even
the
stor
The
way
this
begin
with
character
that
ar
not
real
bad
being
in
leagu
with
bad
character
is
awkward
The
whol
stor
is
not
a
natur
evolution
from
the
previou
on
it
tot
out
of

I
gav
it

It
had
acceptabl

and
good

I
might
hav
enjo

if
I
did
not
expect
so
much
from
it
That
expectat
did
not
hurt
my
view
on
the
previou

in
the

This

A

about

The

that
we
hav
await
for
for
the
past
year
has
fin
arriv
Har
Potter
has
been
through
quit
a
lot
in
his
past
year
at
Hogwart
but
now
it
is
tim
to
mak
the
full
transition
from
child
to
adult
For
the
first
tim
in
film
histor
a
film
bas
on
a
singl
piec
of
literatur
has
been
broken
in
two
in
order
to
bring
the
entir
stor
saf
to
film
Har
Potter
and
the
Death
Hallow
Part
show
us
all
the
step
taken
to
the
fin
showdown
between
Har
Potter
Lord
Voldemort
With
it
com
man
challeng
and
hurdl
for
Har
and
his
friend
to
overcom
This
film
whil
man
call
it
a
hour
filler
is
probab
the
most
overlook
of
all
the
film
This
part
of
the
stor
has
som
of
the
most
incredibl
act
and
character
develop
seen
in
the
past
film
With
som
amaz
heartfelt
moment
that
caus
a
rollercoaster
of
emotion
stat
I
am
quit
surpri
that
this
film
get
so
much
flack
Now
that
I
hav
seen
Part
and
I
can
firm
stat
that
this
section
of
the
fin
chapter
is
in
fact
the
better
movi
I
was
mor
on
edg
watch
this
film
than
the
second
and
mayb
that
is
becau
I
am
on
that
real
appreciat
act
mor
than
action
Not
that
ther
wasn
t
good
act
in
the
second
part
but
you
will
hav
to
wait
for
my
fin
Har
Potter
film
review
when
Har
Potter
and
the
Death
Hallow
Part
is
offici
relea
on
DVD
and
Blu
Ray
I
also
keep
stat
that
I
hav
a
major
beef
with
Blu
Ray
Befor
Blu
Ray
was
relea
they
manag
to
giv
us
just
as
man
speci
featur
on
DVDs
and
now
sinc
Blu
Ray
at
least
to
me
is
noth
but
a
spac
saver
the
film
industr
is
liter
tak
a
massiv
dump
on
DVDs
I
hav
watch
DVDs
and
yes
the
pictur
is
clearer
but
it
is
the
film
itself
that
mak
me
enjo
what
they
are.From
the
ver
start
of
this
movi
to
the
tragic
end
this
movi
will
keep
you
on
your
seat
itch
for
want
to
know
what
happen
next
to
the
trio
of
our
hero
Ron
Hermoni
and
most
of
all
Har
I
must
say
to
all
the
filmmaker
and
actor
of
this
movi
franchi
even
though
it
at
an
end
with
the
second
part
out
now
at
least
i
m
gonna
own
it
all
from
year
on
all
the
way
up
to
year
seven
it
been
fun
watch
thos
three
grow
up
and
learn
mor
each
year
it
ll
be
sad
to
see
them
go
but
know
them
all
thos
year
was
quit
a
great
treat.Lov
the
movi
and
I
order
the
combo
pack
so
I
would
hav
a
digit
cop
Receiv
from
Amazon
t
read
the
book
and
wer
still
abl
to
follow
this
stor
I
read
Death
Hallow
when
it
first
cam
out
but
didn
t
remember
much
of
it
and
the
movi
did
littl
to
refresh
my
memor
Unfortunat
I
rent
it
onlin
so
ther
wer
no
subtitl
that
would
hav
help
me
at
least
follow
the
fast
oftentim
whisper
mumbl
or
his
dialogu
But
even
with
subtitl
I
doubt
that
the
stor
would
hav
been
les
confu
or
mor
interest
The
flashback
scen
or
whatever
they
wer
wer
so
fast
and
so
short
that
most
of
them
didn
t
mak
sen
to
me
The

or
whatever
they
wer
at
the
Ministr
of

that
wer

Everybod

Why

Wouldn
t
that

Why
wer
Har

Ron

What
wer
they
trying
to
accomplish
Did
they
think
they
would
stumbl
acro
a
Horcrux
in
the
middl
of
a
forest
What
was
up
with
that
Bathilda
Bagshot
character
at
Godric
s
Hollow
Did
she
talk
to
Har
in
Parseltongu
Shouldn
t
that
hav
rais
a
red

Why
was
ther
no
discussion
between
Har
and
Hermion
after
Mrs
Bagshot
turn
into
Nagini
I
m
assum
the
locket
they
wer
trying
to
destro
was
Salazar
Slytherin
s
but
was
it
ever
explain
in
the
movi
Why
did
Gryffindor

appear
at

of
a

In
the
middl
of

at

What
was
the

with

that
led

Who

wher

Why
did
the
friend
not
Apparat
to
safet
when
they
wer
pursu
by
the
bad
guy
no
idea
who
they
wer
in
the
forest
On
a
gener
not
of
the
movi
took
plac
in
poor
lit
locat
or
at
night
and
I
found
the
perpetu
gloom
anno
The
onlin
video
qualit
is
not
ver
good
We
tried
to
watch
it
on
our
plasma
TV
but
the
pictur
was
blur
and
blotch
and
we
couldn
t
figur
out
how
to
improv
the
resolution
It
look
oka
on
my
computer
monitor
though.Advanc
the
stor
adequat
at
a
slow
pac
with
a
few
action
and
com
piec
Sometim
got
so
slow
for
so
long
I
began
to
loos
interest
Need
a
good
minut
cut
out
to
mak
it
a
better
film
that
is
mor
in
lin
with
the
pac
of
the
previou
Har
Potter
films.Befor
get
around
to
watch
this
film
I
d
heard
a
lot
of
mix
thing
from
variou
friend
and
onlin
critic
They
wer
say
that
the
film
drag
in
plac
was
fill
with
pointl
part
that
amount
to
noth
and
that
if
someon
hadn
t
read
the
book
they
d
be
complet
confu
as
to
what
was
happen
Most
the
hardcor
Har
Potter
fan
said
it
was
a
great
representat
of
the
book
so
whil
first
slid
the
Blu-Ra
disc
into
my
Playstat
ther
was
a
sen
of
apprehension
The
Death
Hallow
as
a
book
whil
good
has
it
problem
What
if
the
film
turn
out
to
compound
thos
problem
instead
of
solv
them
Man
film
adaptat
hav
a
tendanc
toward
that
Another
thing
that
bother
me
befor
I
d
even
watch
it
was
why
did
they
hav
to
split
this
into
two
film
They
produc
a
great
film
adaptat
of
The
Order
of
the
Phoenix
and
that
book
is
pack
with
way
mor
content
than
DH
The
popular
answer
was
that
WB
could
milk
the
cash
cow
But
com
on
all
the
Har
Potter
film
could
hav
benefit
from
being
split
into
two
part
At
least
DH
will
be
cover
mor
area
than
the
other
wer
allow
Now
that
I
hav
watch
the
film
I
cannot
say
that
I
was
pleasant
surpri
associat
the
word
pleasant
with
DH
seem
wrong
given
how
unforgiv
dark
this
stor
is
Christopher
Nolan
s
The
Dark
Knight
is
a
pup
in
comparison
a
pup
that
bit
your
ankl
but
a
pup
nonethel
But
I
will
say
that
everyth
taken
into
account
DH
is
a
damn
decent
experienc
The
first
scen
giv
us
a
rev
look
at
Voldemort
and
the
Death
Eater
as
they
all
sit
around
a
tabl
to
discu
their
progr
of
univer
dominat
Most
interest
is
that
Severu
Snap
tak
part
in
this
meet
even
after
kill
Dumbledor
in
the
last
install
you
as
the
viewer
will
still
suspect
that
ther
was
mor
to
that
situat
than
meet
the
ey
Snap
is
a
complex
person
It
s
too
bad
that
Alan
Rickman
had
next
to
noth
to
do
in
Part
I
but
it
s
alwa
a
good
diversion
to
look
at
the
character
and
wonder
what
s
going
on
insid
his
head
Rickman

Lucki
you

be
treat
to

of
the
character

in
Part
II
that
is
if
they
keep
true
to
the
novel
which
in
this
cas
they
really-
need
to
do
The

If

you

a
whil
We
follow
our
trio
on
a
quest
that
s
destinat
seem
impossibl
to
reach
both
to
them
and
we
the
viewer
Har
Ron
and
Hermion
need
to
find
the
horcrux
in
order
to
stop
Voldemort
from
ever
reincarnat
but
at
the
sam
tim
they
hav
to
evad
the
countl
Death
Eater
and
Voldemort
sympathizer
that
hav
infiltrat
both
the
basic
wizard
world
and
the
Ministr
of
Magic
itself
They
all
hav
strong
doubt
that
their
mission
can
ever
be
successful
You
ll
feel
that
doubt
along
with
them
becau
this
film
is
fill
with
introspectiv
moment
and
ris
tension
Har
is
determin
but
at
the
sam
tim
jad
and
lost
You
can
hear
it
in
Daniel

Hermion
is
devot
to
help
the
caus

clear

the
incompetenc

She

at
the
top
of
her
gam
in
this
new
wizard
world
of

a
muggle-born
Ron
s
storylin
is
reminiscent
of
The
Goblet
of
Fir
in
that
he
wrestl
with
feel
of
inadequac
when
plac
next
to
Har
and
in

he
goes
over

the
evil
influenc
of

a
nic
nod
to
the
On

from
The
Lord
of

Ring
My
favorit
part
and
what
I
believ
ar
also
objectiv
the
best
part
all
pertain
to
camp
The
trio
ar
isolat
in
their
trip
acro
the
wild
of
Britain
it
s
being
out
in
the
middl
of
nowher
that
we
learn
most
about
them
as
character
and
realiz
how
much
they
ve
matur
over
the
cour
of
the
seri
In
the
past
Har
has
depend
on
the
Dursl
Dumbledor
the
Weasl
but
now
he
s
on
his
own
call
the
shot
and
cut
out
a
shak
existenc
for
himself
and
his
friend
Har
Potter
is
a
man
now
This
film
is
darker
than
I
imagin
the
stor
being
whil
read
the
book
Whil
man
of
the
event
that
transpir
in
both
book
and
film
ar
essenti
the
sam
the
film
s
execution
mak
the
stor
all
the
mor
hopel
cynic
and
grit
On
scen
that
stand
out
is
when
Har
and
Ron
com
up
the
stair
from
the
Malfo
s
bas
to
find
Hermion
lying
on
the
cold
hard
floor
with
mudblood
carv
into
her
flesh
presumab
from
Bellatrix
s
dagger
For
me
this
was
mor
mov
than
an
death
that
happen
in
the
film
thus
far
mayb
it
s
becau
Avada
Kedavra
is
a
painl
relea
from
lif
wherea
the
tortur
and
degradat
of
Hermion
leav
the
viewer
with
the
impression
that
Hermion
will
hav
to
reliv
thos
moment
in
her
mind
for
the
remainder
of
her
lif
In
the
follow
scen
when
the
trio
escap
the
clutch
of
the
Death
Eater
we
ar
met
with
the
sudden
death
of
Dob
the
house-elf
I
see
this
as
being
the
ultimat
end
to
Har
s
childhood
moreso
than
the
death
of
Hedwig
earlier
in
the
film
With
Dob
gon
ther
is
noth
innocent
and
endear
left
in
Har
s
lif
to
anchor
him
to
his
earlier
year
at
Hogwart
Dob
was
alwa
an
anno
character
but
a
lovabl
character
You
couldn
t
help
but
feel
warmth
at
his
effort
to
sav
Har
Potter
tim
and
tim
again
even
when
thos
attempt
endanger
Har
s
physic
well-b
When
Har
buri
Dob
he
s
also
bur
the
last
remnant
of
that
speci
magic
from
the
first
few
film
Ther
is
noth
sweet
left
in
the
univer
until
Har
can
manag
to
defeat
Lord
Voldemort
onc
and
for
all
As
someon
who
has
read
the
book
I
warn
you
that
ther
ar
man
mor
death
to
com
in
Part
II
Major

Whil
darkn
isn
t
a
positiv
attribut
in
and
of
itself
it
s
a
framework
wherein
a
lot
of
meaningful
thing
can
happen
Usu
through
los
or
death
And
a
lot
of
that
happen
in
the
Har
Potter
seri
The
screenpla
writer
Stev
Klov
deliver
much
of
the
potenti
that
com
alongsid
matur
storytell
as
J.K
Rowl
did
to
som
degr
in
the
novel
itself
If
I
had
to
think
of
someth
to
complain
about
it
d
be
that
the
film
mov
too
fast
in
plac
It
s
alread
two
and
a
half
hour
I
believ
it
would
ve
been
a
good
idea
to
stretch
that
out
a
littl
further
to
giv
thes
scen
mor
tim
to
play
out
so
that
the
finish
product
didn
t
seem
lik
such
a
flash
befor
your
eyes.Th
Book
is
way
better
but
I
could
say
that
about
all
the
Har
Potter
Book
If
you
lik
the
other
this
will
not
disappoint
If
you
didn
t
lik
thos
then
why
would
you
consider
this
on
I
say
go
read
the
book
to
find
out
what
happen
It
will
be
a
much
better
experienc
than
this
will.Th
way
to
go
with
the
Har

collection
is
by

blura
Be
careful
with
the

This

BY

my
favorit
HP

The
HP
film
hav
alwa
been
a
bit
of
a
disappoint
to
me
but
begin
with
GoF
each
film
has
becom
better
than
the
on
befor
it
With
that
said
ther
ar
som
omission
from
the
book
but
you
can
t
get
everyth
about
this
book
into
a
hour
movi
I
person
think
each
HP
movi
should
ve
been
at
least
hour
long
just
becau
of
the
wealth
of
materi
in
them
I
lov
everyth
about
this
movi
The
direct
is
great
the
act
is
superb
the

and
visu
ar
wonderful
I
just
can
t
say
enough
about
how
well
this

has
been

GET
IT
I
hav
to
agr
that
this

leav
a
lot
to
be

As
a
hp
fan
I
anticipat
the
movi
and
expect
them
to
liv
up
to
the
hype
This
film
was
mood
and
had
littl
to
no
plot
The
gang
spend
the
majorit
of
the
movi
search
for
horcrux
in
the
wildern
On
the
other
hand
the
production
team
was
abl
to
do
a
good
job
to
mak
the
movi
an
entertain
visu
experience.I
purcha
this
Blu-Ra
t
yet
hav
a
Blu-Ra
player
it
just
seem
smarter
to
pay
a
few
dollar
extra
sinc
I
anticipat
us
get
on
down
the
lin
and
this
is
a
must
hav
movi
for
our
Har
Potter
lov
fami
The
movi
itself
is
fantastic
I
absolut
lov
it
I
could
spend
all
day
talk
Har
Potter
but
I
believ
this
review
should
be
dedicat
to
the
product
and
not
the
movi
that
is
what
movi
review
websit
ar
for
I
cannot
attest
to
the
qualit
of
the
Blu-Ra
but
the
DVD
disappoint
me
for
two
reason
The
first
thing
to
disappoint
me
was
that
the
outsid
of
the
packag
said
it
includ
extra
scen
Thes
must
be
on
the
Blu-Ra
becau
the
on
thing
on
the
DVD
is
the
movi
itself
and
noth
extra
except

The
second
thing
that
disappoint
me
with
this
product
was
the
pictur
qualit
on
the
DVD
It
isn
t
horribl
throughout
but
ther
ar
part
wher
the
screen
is
so
dark
that
it
is
hard
to
see
the
pictur
I
thought
this
might
just
be
the
DVD
player
I
was
us
but
I
hav
sinc
watch
it
in
a
second
DVD
player
and
also
on
a
laptop
and
I
ve
experienc
the
sam
pictur
qualit
issu
I
can
t
say
I
wouldn
t
buy
this
again
I
did
get
it
for
a
great
pric
but
I
would
definit
not
pay
full
retail
know
what
I
know
now.I
was
ver
satisfi
with
this
D
First
of
all
I
decid
to
Buy
the
Blu-ra
