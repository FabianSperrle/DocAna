This
is
the
fourth
DVD
of
the
Adventures
of
Sherlock
Holmes
and
it
presents
two
of
the
best
mysteries
that
Sir
Arthur
Conan
Doyle
wrote
They
both
succeed
to
varying
degrees
The
Greek
Interpreter-
The
title
character
is
abducted
and
forced
to
aid
two
villains
who
are
torturing
a
Greek
speaking
man
to
get
him
to
sign
a
mysterious
paper
This
was
the
only
story
where
Sherlock
s
brilliant
elder
brother
Mycroft
is
shown
I
do
not
know
if
he
appears
in
other
episodes
of
the
series
Doyle
s
short
stories
are
so
short
that
all
of
the
TV
series
episodes
had
to
pad
to
fill
out
the
hour
running
time
and
so
this
episode
has
a
longer
and
much
more
drawn
out
ending
than
what
was
originally
in
the
story
All
around
very
good
The
Norwood
Builder-
A
house
burns
down
and
the
fireman
find
a
body
in
the
cinders
They
suspect
a
young
lawyer
who
begs
Holmes
to
look
after
his
case
since
he
claims
to
be
totally
innocent
But
all
appearances
are
against
him
and
it
appears
that
Holmes
may
finally
have
a
case
that
is
unsolvable
This
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
series
totally
enjoyable
One
note
I
found
that
most
of
the
DVDs
in
this
series
choked
on
my
DVD
player
unless
they
are
scrupulously
cleaned
and
totally
lint
free
I
don
t
know
if
anyone
else
has
this
problem
I
have
not
run
into
it
from
other
DVDs
However
the
discs
run
very
well
in
my
computers
DVD
drive
Just
a
side
point
This
is
a
wonderful
series
crammed
full
of
great
acting
and
amazing
set
design
this
is
one
of
the
best
entries
and
I
hope
everyone
will
want
to
try
it
out.Once
again
Jeremy
Brett
and
David
Burke
are
at
the
top
of
their
game
as
the
immortal
Sherlock
Holmes
and
Dr
Watson
in
the
th
DVD
volume
of
this
classic
TV
series
This
time
Holmes
must
join
forces
with
his
even
more
eccentric
brother
Mycroft
in
solving
the
case
of
a
kidnapping
involving
Greek
nationals
In
the
second
case
a
young
lawyer
is
accused
of
murdering
a
former
lover
of
his
mother
Only
Holmes
can
save
the
lad
from
the
gallows
As
always
Brett
and
Burke
are
the
definitive
Holmes
and
Watson
while
Charles
Gray
best
known
for
his
roles
in
a
couple
of
James
Bond
films
is
an
eccentric
treat
as
Mycroft
Holmes
The
care
and
intelligence
of
this
BBC
older
brother
Mycroft
for
the
first
time
Mycroft
is
played
by
Charles
Gray
who
played
the
role
in
the
feature
film
of
the
s
The
Seven
Percent
Solution
with
Nicol
Williamspn
Robert
Duvall
and
Alan
Arkin
In
The
Norwood
Builder
an
old
builder
writes
a
new
will
leaving
everything
to
a
lawyer
then
promptly
dies
and
the
young
solicitor
gets
accused
of
the
crime
This
episode
introduces
the
one
Scotland
Yard
Investigator
that
Holmes
can
t
stand
Lestrade
played
by
Colin
Jeavons
Eventually
he
will
earn
Holmes
respect
Keep
em
coming
MPI
Video.While
many
famous
actors
have
portrayed
the
detective
quite
well
over
the
years
it
cannot
be
denied
that
Jeremy
Brett
captured
the
very
essence
of
the
Sherlock
Holmes
character
Christopher
Lee
Christopher
Plummer
Ian
Richardson
and
of
course
Basil
Rathbone
all
put
their
own
spin
on
Holmes
For
the
most
part
these
interpretations
are
satisfactory
and
entertaining
but
no
one
other
then
Brett
had
seriously
attempted
to
portray
the
character
as
written
by
Doyle
Here
we
have
two
of
the
very
very
best
of
the
Granada
series
Both
The
Greek
Interpreter
and
The
Norwood
Builder
have
much
to
recommend
them
including
a
fine
performace
by
Charles
Gray
as
Mycroft
in
the
former
and
an
insufferable
never
more
smug
Lestrade
shown
in
the
latter
Incredible
cinematography
permeates
Interpreter
with
excellent
use
of
shadows
aboard
a
blazing
red
fire-lit
train
in
the
Scotland
Yard
offices
and
in
the
closed
mansion
that
serves
as
a
prison
for
a
hapless
Greek
citizen
Builder
has
other
singular
elements
such
as
the
aforementioned
smug
Lestrade
Colin
Jeavons
putting
his
stamp
on
the
character
just
as
David
Burke
and
Edward
Hardwicke
did
Watson
and
Brett
did
Holmes
We
also
have
a
frustrated
and
depressed
Holmes
desperate
to
solve
a
case
where
Lestrade
seems
to
hold
all
the
cards
However
one
element
I
would
like
to
illuminate
which
bears
out
my
sentiment
of
true-to-Doyle
is
how
Brett
works
the
room
In
The
Resident
Patient
available
in
Volume
of
this
collection
Brett
truly
displays
what
it
must
have
been
like
to
actually
see
this
amazing
detective
in
his
element
as
he
works
the
room
in
Blessington
s
home
decucing
the
facts
that
occured
when
that
character
met
his
death
Never
more
brilliantly
portrayed
than
in
The
Resident
Patient
we
nonetheless
have
an
excellent
example
of
Brett
using
Holmes
methods
here
in
The
Norwood
Builder
while
investigating
the
remnants
of
the
fire
the
upper
floors
of
the
house
and
the
surrounding
grounds
We
see
the
intensity
and
frenetic
energy
of
the
famous
consulting
detective
crouching
scurrying
examining
in
minute
detail
the
invisible
evidence
hunting
up
the
clues
unobserved
by
others
We
also
have
samples
of
Holmes
and
Mycroft
deducing
the
lives
of
people
they
observe
both
on
the
train
and
in
Mycroft
s
club
For
those
unfamilliar
with
the
Granada
series
this
may
not
be
the
best
place
to
start
because
the
cases
are
more
obscure
than
the
more
famous
The
Speckled
Band
or
The
Crooked
Man
However
for
those
familiar
with
Brett
Co
this
disc
is
indispensible.For
my
money
Jeremy
Brett
is
the
best
Sherlock
Holmes
complete
with
the
high-strung
nervous
disposition
tics
and
eccentricities
David
Burke
is
a
solid
capable
intelligent
Dr.Watson
no
Nigel
Bruce
type
bumbler
fool
The
production
values
of
the
Granada
series
excellent
the
stories
told
with
fidelity
The
stars
are
therefore
for
Sherlockians
The
Greek
Interpreter
is
notable
for
things
the
first
appearance
of
Sherlock
s
older
brother
the
brilliant
but
sedentary
Mycroft
wonderfully
played
by
Charles
Gray
and
the
fact
that
in
this
tale
Sherlock
is
too
late
deducing
and
is
further
delayed
in
getting
the
authority
to
save
one
of
the
principles
of
the
story
even
Sherlock
wasn
t
perfect
The
Norwood
Builder
has
Sherlock
unraveling
a
crime
utilizing
all
his
methods
including
disguise
in
an
effort
to
save
a
wrongly
accused
man
something
he
does
often
as
in
the
Blue
Carbuncle
This
series
was
notable
for
the
care
in
its
production
and
casting
re-telling
the
tales
of
the
Sherlock
canon
with
respect
and
reverence.Once
again
the
brilliant
performances
of
Jeremy
Brett
as
Sherlock
Holmes
are
slapped
two-to-a-DVD
with
few
extras
and
at
the
same
price
as
Volume
s
three
episode
disc
Save
your
money
a
five-DVD
box
set
is
coming
in
May
at
a
better
per-disc
price
This
DVD
presents
two
of
the
minute
Sherlock
Holmes
episodes
that
had
Jeremy
Brett
as
Sherlock
and
David
Burke
as
Dr
Watson
Each
episode
is
based
on
a
story
written
by
Sir
Arthur
Conan
Doyle
to
who
wrote
short
stories
and
novels
about
Sherlock
Holmes
The
Greek
Interpreter
scenes
based
on
the
story
Sherlock
s
smarter
older
and
rotund
brother
Mycroft
Charles
Gray
whose
favorite
hangout
is
the
snobby
Diogenes
Club
asks
Sherlock
to
investigate
a
strange
case
A
Greek
language
interpreter
was
asked
to
translate
into
English
the
answers
to
a
series
of
questions
posed
to
a
kidnapped
man
who
only
speaks
Greek
The
kidnappers
objective
was
to
get
the
Greek
man
to
sign
some
important
documents
Once
the
Greek
interpreter
s
job
was
done
he
notified
Mycroft
of
the
incident
who
then
notified
Sherlock
Holmes
takes
on
the
case
because
kidnapping
could
become
murder
Look
for
Charles
Gray
s
superb
performance
as
brother
Mycroft
Also
look
for
actor
George
Costigan
s
outstanding
performance
as
the
strangely
laughing
leader
of
this
kidnapping
ring
The
only
minor
problem
I
had
with
this
episode
is
that
we
are
not
told
what
documents
are
to
be
signed
and
why
they
re
so
important
The
Norwood
Builder
scenes
based
on
the
story
A
young
lawyer
goes
straight
to
Sherlock
after
a
client
a
builder
or
carpenter
who
lives
in
the
small
village
of
Norwood
he
saw
at
the
client
s
home
the
previous
night
is
murdered
and
his
body
burned
in
a
fire
According
to
Inspector
Lestrade
Colin
Jeavons
the
young
lawyer
is
obviously
guilty
of
murder
because
it
is
discovered
that
he
had
a
motive
for
murder
However
Sherlock
is
not
so
sure
and
smokes
the
truth
out
The
quotation
by
Dr
Watson
that
titles
this
review
is
found
in
this
episode
Look
for
the
fine
performance
of
Colin
Jeavons
as
the
efficient
and
stern
Inspertor
Lestrade
who
butts
heads
with
Sherlock
Brett
who
made
Sherlock
Holmes
dramas
between
and
is
in
top-form
in
these
two
episodes
since
they
were
made
before
the
time
of
his
health
problems
He
captures
the
essence
of
the
famous
gumshoe
in
his
performances
The
costumes
background
music
and
cinematography
are
quite
well
done
In
my
case
I
found
the
picture
and
sound
quality
of
this
DVD
to
be
practically
perfect
Finally
the
DVD
has
some
extras
Newcomers
to
the
series
should
enjoy
them
In
conclusion
be
sure
to
view
this
DVD
and
see
why
it
won
a
Swedish
Academy
of
Detection
Award
