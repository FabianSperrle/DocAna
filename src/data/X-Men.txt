This
pictur
will
be
much
appreciat
by
the
fan
of
the
X-Men
comic
book
In
the
past
my
wif
read
thes
comic
and
so
i
knew
going
in
a
littl
about
the
charecter
However
someon
not
familiar
with
the
book
may
hav
a
bit
of
troubl
with
the
charecter
All
in
all
a
fun
movi
and
i
feel
the
best
of
the
comic
adaptat
The
pictur
qualit
was
great
and
ther
is
lot
of
action
so
as
long
as
on
doesnt
expect
a
mind
excersi
it
should
be
an
enjoyabl
movi
for
most.W
can
accept
other
as
on
or
not
Rac
relat
taken
to
a
new
depth
via
mutant
vs
human
just
as
it
was
in
black
vs
whit
in
the
US
and
South
Africa
Do
we
choos
to
liv
together
as
on
or
to
fight
to
destro
the
other
We
must
choos
The
X-Men
chos
to
liv
with
us
and
help
us
This
film
was
also
a
ver
entertain
movi
as
I
grew
up
with
the
X-Men
comic
book
It
has
mild
violenc
but
is
a
good
movi
for
the
averag
teen
and
adult
Definat
in
my
keep
files.Whenever
a
comic
to
movi
transfer
occur
an
extraordin
amount
of
originalit
is
requir
or
el
the
movi
will
simp
be
aweful
Comic
book
ar
a
ver
choos
