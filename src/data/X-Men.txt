This
picture
will
be
much
appreciated
by
the
fans
of
the
X-Men
comic
books
In
the
past
my
wife
read
these
comics
and
so
i
knew
going
in
a
little
about
the
charecters
However
someone
not
familiar
with
the
books
may
have
a
bit
of
trouble
with
the
charecters
All
in
all
a
fun
movie
and
i
feel
the
best
of
the
comic
adaptations
The
picture
quality
was
great
and
there
is
lots
of
action
so
as
long
as
one
doesnt
expect
a
mind
excersise
it
should
be
an
enjoyable
movie
for
most.We
can
accept
others
as
one
or
not
Race
relations
taken
to
a
new
depth
via
mutants
vs
humans
just
as
it
was
in
black
vs
white
in
the
US
and
South
Africa
Do
we
choose
to
live
together
as
one
or
to
fight
to
destroy
the
other
We
must
choose
The
X-Men
chose
to
live
with
us
and
help
us
This
film
was
also
a
very
entertaining
movie
as
I
grew
up
with
the
X-Men
comic
books
It
has
mild
violence
but
is
a
good
movie
for
the
average
teen
and
adult
Definately
in
my
keep
files.Whenever
a
comic
to
movie
transfer
occurs
an
extraordinary
amount
of
originality
is
required
or
else
the
movie
will
simply
be
aweful
Comic
books
are
a
very
choosy
medium
that
require
the
reader
to
fill
in
many
of
the
mental
gaps
and
assume
a
wide
variety
of
odd
comic
book
physics
These
things
when
translated
into
a
live
action
movie
generally
appear
to
be
campy
and
unrealistic
if
not
altered
dramatically
Thank
god
Marvel
finally
got
that
hint
after
a
fleet
of
terrible
comic
book
movies
and
gave
the
X-Men
a
new
look
and
feel
so
that
they
work
on
the
big
screen
I
m
not
just
talking
about
the
costumes...I
m
talking
about
the
character
attitudes
the
character
interactions
and
specifically
the
filming
of
the
action
scenes
Like
the
Tim
Burton
Batman
films
this
is
comic
book
adaptation
done
well
The
amazing
performances
by
Hugh
Jackman
Patrick
Stewart
and
others
outweigh
the
wooden
and
unengaging
performances
by
some
of
the
supporting
cast
fortunately
they
didn
t
give
Storm
many
lines
This
will
make
a
good
movie
franchise.This
was
a
great
movie
The
storyline
was
easy
to
follow
and
thorough
The
special
effects
were
fantastic
There
wasn
t
that
many
characters
but
the
characters
were
great
Magneto
was
a
good
villain
I
can
t
wait
until
the
sequal
Hopefully
in
the
sequal
there
will
be
more
superheroes
and
villains
and
the
storyline
will
still
be
great
I
would
like
to
see
Arnold
Swarzenneggar
play
Colossus
and
Jean
Claude
Van
Damme
or
Mel
Gibson
play
Gambit
Spiderman
will
be
out
in
theaters
in
May
of
for
anybody
who
wants
to
know.X-Men
was
the
movie
that
made
me
want
a
DVD
The
ability
to
watch
this
new
classic
in
surround
sound
and
crisp
graphics
made
me
drool
so
much
that
I
got
a
player
I
admit-
I
watch
X-Men
and
see
where
something
could
have
been
added
and
where
something
should
have
been
taking
away
True
fans
who
kept
with
the
film
now
why
the
movie
is
the
way
it
is
but
for
those
that
don
t
the
studio
rushed
it
so
good
bye
masterpiece
hello
action
junk
But
there
are
three
miracles
working
on
this
movie
Bryan
Singer
the
actors
the
story
Despite
hacky
editing
bad
studio
BOO
the
movie
is
still
awesome
Bryan
and
his
team
manage
to
keep
the
magic
alive
through
a
good
plot
and
honest
acting
Fans
love
it
because
we
grew
up
with
these
characters
They
could
do
a
pop
album
and
we
d
buy
it-let
s
be
honest
Non
fans
get
an
introduction
to
one
of
the
most
extrodinary
inventive
and
original
tales
ever
Don
t
trust
me
I
got
proof-you
know
a
movie
is
good
when
you
hear
people
gasp
when
Mystique
transform
or
little
boys
yelling
COOL
when
Wolverine
pops
his
claws
or
applause
during
the
credits
Now
that
is
a
good
movie
Now
add
some
extras
like
deleted
scenes
designs
a
making
of
and
you
got
a
classic
DVD
Get
it
now
bub.The
movie
is
great
even
with
some
flaws
in
the
plot
The
only
disappointment
is
that
this
DVD
release
has
virtually
no
bonus
material
only
trailers
and
minutes
of
cut-out
scenes
I
expected
more.This
is
not
a
great
movie
but
it
is
entertaining
in
a
quality
campy
sort
of
way
It
also
spends
much
time
setting
up
the
characters
allowing
for
more
interesting
sequels.People
will
always
find
every
little
detail
to
tear
a
film
apart
Being
a
long
time
X-Men
fan
I
loved
the
movie
for
the
pure
joy
of
seeing
the
characters
come
to
life
They
were
brilliant
The
special
effects
were
awesome
and
the
DVD
comes
with
great
extras
worth
the
price
by
themselves
My
kids
loved
it
and
even
my
wife
enjoyed
the
action
and
drama
A
worthwhile
addition
to
any
DVD
collection
X-Men
fan
or
not.The
soundtrack
was
good
the
action
sequences
everything
I
could
have
hoped
for
the
claws
I
had
goosebumps
and
the
story
was
about
par
for
the
course
I
watched
it
and
I
saw
a
fine
tradition
of
comics
make
it
s
first
successful
transition
to
the
big
screen
I
was
thrilled
and
excited
Like
the
first
time
Superman
and
Spiderman
teamed
up
I
have
to
say
that
when
I
first
heard
about
this
movie
I
was
sure
that
They
couldn
t
get
the
characters
right
Well
I
was
wrong
Cyclops
Jean
Grey
Wolverine
Xavier
were
all
magnificent
There
were
some
adjustments
made
to
ages
of
other
characters
but
that
s
okay
Every
story
teller
changes
things
to
suit
their
tale
I
think
Grace
Jones
would
have
made
a
better
Storm
