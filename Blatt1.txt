The data contains reviews of different movies.  The data contains the title of the movie in form of a productId, the name of the reviewer, a score, a time-stamp 
and a review summary, as well as a review text. Users have the possibility to rate how helpful the review was to them. It is possible to count how often each movie is reviewed, 
and what person writes the most reviews. Additionally we could perform time analysis and see whether there is a month in which more reviews are published and whether the genres 
viewed change throughout the year
