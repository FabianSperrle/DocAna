2. Using Java's internal StreamTokenizer class tokenizing strings is super easy. The only little catch we had to look out 
for were strings in quotation marks, that needed a recursive call to be handled properly. Later, we used the new Stream 

API to efficiently clean off remaining trailing periods, and return the result as an Array of strings. 


3. We had no problems extracting the sentences of the reviews with the java String.split() function.
However, problems arise if the sentences contain abbreviations. A sentence normally ends with a word, followed by
a . an empty space a a new word of the next sentence, with has a capital starting letter. Our current regex 
looks for a fullstop and determines if the word following afterwards starts with a capital letter via a look ahead. 
However this might also match abbreviations followed by a word with a starting captal letter.
As the reviews are written in English, we have to consider the English language. In English only names, days 
and months as well as some abbreviations have a starting capital letter on their own. So even though the sentence might sometimes
be split incorrectly, it should not happen very often.
